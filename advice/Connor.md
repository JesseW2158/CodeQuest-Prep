Here are my post CodeQuest thoughts I wrote on the bus ride home.
 
Post code quest thoughts:
 
  1. they asked for id but don't require it?  
 
  2. they let us use 3 laptops, we only brought 1 and had 2 given. - i don’t know if i like having 3 laptops instead of 1, it reduces the teamwork aspect.  

  3. brought my own keyboard. in my opinion my laptop keyboard is too small so i brought my own, this definitely helped me code faster because i'm much more comfortable with it
    3a. my keyboard was rgb, the intimidation factor of this was noticeable, the team in front of us said they saw it and got scared (they were in novice division, though). the speaker also complimented it.
  
    3b. mouse - even if no keyboard, bring a mouse, the utility of it over a trackpad is incredible
  
    3c. mousepad - i brought my desk sized mouse pad which was helpful instead of using a mouse on the wooden desk
  
    3d. if using mac, make sure your keyboard is set so you’re familiar with it (cmd on mac has some functionality of ctrl on windows — copy paste, undo/redo, but in other cases control on mac is the same as control on windows (ctrl + space to autofill sysout, alt + tab vs cmd + tab) 
 
  4. practice - we definitely could have done more practice, (code quest academy) however the knowledge from using java every other day for 2 years (CSA,DSA) was the basis for my ability to get 225 points and our teams 380  
  
  5. our original 1 laptop strategy was to skip to 4-5 and for me to speed through the easy ones while spencer and zhang work out the logic for more difficult ones
    5a. we did a semi-practice round last night where we talked about this strategy and tried to practice coding on a laptop. one thing we noticed is that it is super convenient to not have to deal with doing the same scanner input each time, so i made a template class that i just paste in each submission (will share with explanation)
 
    5b. another thing that night i realized is that some questions are math based, so i asked chatgpt to write a bunch of functions in a class that i could copy and paste in if needed. i used one function that it wrote (greatest common denominator function for a coprime problem) and it easily saved 5 minutes of having to figure that out. (problem 9 i believe)
 
    5c. we were discussing other divisions from previous years and found that multiple other divisions had teams in the top 3 with scores in the 500+ range, we said that if we were trailing in the leaderboards to a team that looked like they were gonna hit this, we throw a hail mary and start trying the 20+ problems in hopes of solving one and pushing us up, just an idea that didn’t end up happening because we were in first the whole time.
 
  6. new strategy - when we were told we had 3 laptops our new strategy was give me numbers 1 through 10, while they work on the teens they think are doable. clearly this worked, however i was in a bit of a weird place, where it took me about 2 hours to do 1-10, and i had ~30minutes where i didn’t end up solving anything else. i probably could have done 11 or 12 but spencer had done them already, i tried 14 but didn't end up finishing, so maybe the speed person saves 1-11 for themself, and by the 2 hour mark if they are still working on 10 or less, they give 11 or less to another person?  
 
  7. play to your teams strengths, your goal is to win. in my opinion you should have one person who is fastest coding the early ones. while later problems that don’t necessarily need speed, but brainpower can be done by slower coders.  
 
  8. do not get stuck in the sunk cost fallacy on a difficult problem, if you have the first test case correct and you cannot find your error for more than ~10-20 minutes, give up and move on, you will think oh but i’m so close i can’t give up now. give up and move on anyways. this is what happened to zhang on #13, leading to 0 points from him sadly.  
   
  9. leaderboards - you can no longer see other peoples score after 2 hours, however you can see the problems they submitted. using this information we were able to conclude (early) that even if the teams below us got right every problem they submitted post 30 minutes, we still won by like 25 points. they didn’t end up scoring so we won by 110. i don’t recommend this, but if you want to scare or surprise other teams you could either save code to submit post 2 hours, or submit on every problem a blank file so it looks scary.- just a dumb idea i had post comp.  
 
  10. tour - this year it was barely even a tour we just walked to a place to take a picture with everyone and then walked back  
   
  11. WE WON! and i don’t technically have prof of this but im pretty sure i got the highest individual with 225 points. with spencer’s 155 we got a total of 380, +110 over second places 270. overall could have gone better but also could have gone much worse.
The 'extras.java' file is the file with all of the math equations written by chatGPT, I ended up only using one, but even that one was worth the 30 seconds it took to generate. The 'template.java' file is what I started with for each problem (without the comments, they are only there to explain how to use it).
 
Good Luck to people next year!
