# Battle Strategy
I suggest we split up by having:
- **frontrunner**: someone spearheading the ez problems
- **planner**: someone who plans out the problem
- **triage planner**: (bonus) someone who plans multiple problems or gets a rough idea so we know which ones to prioritize
Since we have multiple computers, we can actually all commit to being any role and it will allow us to work more efficiently, but it is suggested to have:
- 1 frontrunner, 1 planner, and 1 triage planner
- but the roles can swap midway if needed and the triage planner could become a planner?
- I think for at least the beginning:
	- JESSE FRONTRUNNER
	- ARNAV PLANNER
	- MASON TRIAGE
The frontrunner should be the fastest in Python/Java and be able to instantly crack some problems.
The planners should be good at math/problem solving or be able to make connections between utility functions and problems.

# Frontrunner
The frontrunner will be someone super sigma who will get the problems done lickity split. They should MOVE ON if they get stuck on a problem for probably more than 30m or something.
People can rotate in and used shared notes if required.
# Solving a Problem (Planning)
Solving a Problem requires:
1. Read the Problem
2. Break the Problem into Segmented Parts
	1. Identify what Utility Functions (if any) are required for the parts
	2. Identify Data Structures & Algorithms to be used
3. Code Each Relevant Part
	1. Log Aggressively if things go wrong
	2. If an error happens, hopefully only one small part will be broken

Please note that, at least for the harder problems, it may not be the best idea to flock right to code after reading the problem as you should understand the entire process and how each part of the problem effects each other part.

# Triage Planning
For this role, make sure you:
- read each problem and understand general gist and dependencies
- what are the bottlenecks of each problem?
- make a big list on paper and compare different problems to see what should be solved
- share resources with planner (paper)
